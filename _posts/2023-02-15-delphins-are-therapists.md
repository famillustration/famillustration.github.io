Appearances can often be deceiving, revealing a duality between what seems to be and what actually is. This idea reflects the depth of beings and things, and how the surface can sometimes hide unexpected, even disturbing realities.

Take dolphins, for example, these marine creatures that for many embody grace, intelligence, and benevolence. Their appearance works in their favor, with their perpetual smiles and complex social behaviors. However, this idyllic image hides a lesser-known reality: some male dolphins exhibit aggressive and violent behaviors, including acts of sexual violence towards their peers and even other species.

This dissonance between the charming image and the brutal reality reminds us that apparent beauty and innocence can often conceal darker aspects. It encourages us to look beyond appearances and recognize the intrinsic complexity of nature and the beings that compose it.

This reflection invites us to question the obvious and explore the hidden truths beneath the deceptive surface of appearances.
